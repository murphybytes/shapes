# shapes

This little program is based on an interview question. Given a grid where zero's represent empty space and ones represent 
space, find all unique shapes within the grid. 
```
000001100    
000011000    
000011110    
000000000
001110000

   111
     11 
    11
    1111
```
    
For example, in the grid above the ones represent a shape, note that the shapes can wrap as this example illustrates.
